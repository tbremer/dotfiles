Hey all,

I wanted to express my interest in your Developer Relations role and working with the team at Glitch.

I am a web developer and user advocate. I believe in making the web accessible, performant, easy to use, and easy to build on. As development professionals, we are responsible to our end-users and other builders to provide tools that allow for quick iteration and rapid deployment; we must do this while keeping in mind the impact our work has on the environment and world around us.

My professional development experience encompasses many technology stacks, use cases, end-users, and design requirements as a consultant. I've had the good fortune of working in web, native mobile, and also helping build and maintain deployment and automation infrastructure.

Over the past couple of years, I have made time for both individual contributions and taking on roles as a mentor, teacher, and skill-building specialist. I've been encouraged to lean into my "back of the class" teaching style and people-centered advocacy. I believe this role would allow me to grow further in those skills while still maintaining a technical foundation in problem-solving. 

You can view some open source work on GitHub at https://github.com/tbremer or find out more about me at https://tbremer.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Tom.
