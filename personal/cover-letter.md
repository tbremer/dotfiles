I wanted to reach out and show my interest in your opening for a User Interface Engineer, I am currently supporting the development of a UI Framework for an internal client. Daily I am tasked with moving designs into code and manual processes into automated ones. I do this on the clientside with: HTML, Sass, and Javascript. In the development environment with: NodeJS, Gulp, Grunt, ES6 (Babel and IOJS), and Bash. I have done work in React, FlightJS and small tasks in Ember.

I have experience in A/B testing, iterative design and development, and building frameworks. My bachelors studies were focused in Fine Arts, specifically photography. I am an advocate for Open Source projects and enjoy contributing to new, evolving and established projects. I am also a ['vinyl', 'coffee', 'beer', 'cycling', 'running'] enthusiast.
