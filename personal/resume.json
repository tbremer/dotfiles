    "summary": "<p>I am a product engineer and end-user advocate dedicated to creating accessible, high-performance, and user-friendly experiences on the open web. I champion inclusive design and prioritize ease of use, ensuring equitable access for all users</p><p>My approach emphasizes simplicity and best practices in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver efficient and maintainable code. I enjoy learning about and exploring emerging technologies and aim to find the most lightweight solutions when appropriate. My emphasis on core web technologies allows me to build optimized, flexible applications that are easy to maintain</p><p>For systems and server work I am comfortable working with PostgresSQL, Rust, CosmosDB, Redis, Neo4j. I've primarily worked with backends powered by Node.js, but have experience with PHP, Laravel, and Ruby. Additionally before Vercel I have built and maintained CI/CD systems powered by Github Actions, Azure DevOps, GCP Cloud Build, and Jenkins.</p>",
